            `When the crowds begin to wear you down, Hanoi has a bundle of places to visit where you can escape for some peace. Hoan Kiem Lake is a relaxing respite right within the city, while the Temple of Literature and Vietnam Museum of Ethnology provide plenty of opportunities to reflect on Vietnam's grand history.`,

            'Hoi An has captivated the imaginations of artists and photographers for hundreds of years. In the 18th Century, Hoi An was one of the most important trading ports in the South China Sea. Languages of the world were spoken in its alleyways, artisans swapped materials and inspiration, and Hoianese handcrafts like ceramics were traded as far away as Egypt and Portugal. The ancient town has preserved this dynamic legacy in structures like the Japanese Bridge and Chinese Temples, its architecture a living memory of Japanese and Chinese and European roots.',

Horizon-bound rice paddies undulate in ten thousand shades of green or reflect the sky back to itself in a mirror of flooded fields.',
            'Hoi An was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1999, and it retains the weight and heartbeat of its centuries of commerce and culture and dreams. There is something about the city that transforms every guest into an artist or photographer. Here are some of its most photogenic and Instagram-worthy sites and scenes.',
